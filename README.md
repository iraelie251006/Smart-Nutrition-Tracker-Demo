## 🎯 Overview

Child malnutrition affects millions of children in Rwanda and across Africa, leading to stunted growth, poor learning outcomes, and school dropouts. While food may be available, many families lack:

- **Nutritional knowledge** on balanced diets
- **Access to diverse, affordable foods**
- **Real-time guidance** on proper child feeding
- **Early detection** of malnutrition

The **Smart Nutrition Platform** bridges this gap by combining mobile technology, AI-driven insights, and community networks to ensure no child goes hungry and every child can learn and grow healthy.
